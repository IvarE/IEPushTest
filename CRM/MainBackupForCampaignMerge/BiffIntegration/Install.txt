  Example "C:\Program Files (x86)\Endeavor\BiffIntegration\BiffIntegration.exe" /Password:XYZ
  You will receive an error message that you cannot start a service from the command line. The password will be stored anyway.
  Observe that you must create the password using the same account as the service will execute under. I.e. if the user ScheduleSvc
  is used as the service account then your need to login or runas this user when setting the password.
  The runas program does not work with local system, so if you wish to run the service with local system then you need to use psexec to
  start a command prompt with local system.
