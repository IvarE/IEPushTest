Installation
* Use the Release (not Debug) build to install the service.
* Prefered installation folder is C:\Program Files (x86)\Endeavor\DeltabatchService.
* Installation of the service should be made in an Administrator Command Prompt.
* Use "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe" "C:\Program Files (x86)\DeltabatchService\DeltabatchService.exe" to install the application.

Update configuration
* Change the application config file and enter the correct connection information.

To use integrated authentication
* Set the account on the installed service. The account must have read and update rights to the Schedule entities in CRM.
* Set the EndpointType setting in the application config file to ActiveDirectory.
* Clear	the UserName setting in the application config file.

To use stored credentials
* Set the UserName setting in the application config file
* Run the service application with the /Password:XYZ parameter to store the password. 
  Example "C:\Program Files (x86)\DeltabatchService\DeltabatchService.exe" /Password:XYZ
  You will receive an error message that you cannot start a service from the command line. The password will be stored anyway.
  Observe that you must create the password using the same account as the service will execute under. I.e. if the user ScheduleSvc
  is used as the service account then your need to login or runas this user when setting the password.
  The runas program does not work with local system, so if you wish to run the service with local system then you need to use psexec to
  start a command prompt with local system.
